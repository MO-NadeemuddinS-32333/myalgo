# myalgo

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and modules related to algorithmic trading and automation, with a focus on strategies for the Zerodha trading platform. The project includes logic for various trading strategies, backtesting tools, session management, and automation scripts for handling trading sessions and orders.

> **Note:** This repository is private and intended for personal or restricted use.

## Features

- **Trading Strategies**: Implementation of multiple trading strategies such as Supertrend (including multi-Supertrend logic), mean reversal, premium eating, and more.
- **Automation Scripts**: Includes scripts for session generation, TOTP login automation, and order placement automation.
- **Backtesting Tools**: Scripts for backtesting strategies using historical data.
- **Market Data Utilities**: Tools to fetch OHLC data, scan for candlestick patterns and pivots, and analyze top movers.
- **Paper Trading Support**: Several strategies have built-in paper trading flags for testing without live execution.
- **API Key & Token Management**: Contains scripts and files for managing API keys and session tokens.
- **Directory for Important Codes**: The `imp final codes/` directory may contain final or production-ready scripts.

## Notable Files

- `mainfile.py` — Likely the main entry point or orchestrator for running algorithms.
- `3 supertrend zerodha logic.py`, `three_supertrends_v2.py` — Multi-Supertrend implementations.
- `supertrend strategy with paper trading flag.py` — Supertrend strategy with paper trading support.
- `premium eater place order plus paper trade logs.py` — Premium eating strategy with logging.
- `backtest.py`, `backtest23.py` — Backtesting scripts.
- `access_token automation of session generation totp login.py` — Script for automating session and token generation.
- `imp final codes/` — Directory containing additional important scripts.
- `api_key.txt`, `access_token.txt` — Store sensitive keys/tokens (ensure these are properly secured and not shared publicly).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MO-NadeemuddinS-32333/myalgo.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install required libraries as used in the scripts, for example:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy requests
     ```
   - Additional requirements may be specified within individual scripts.

3. **Configure API Keys:**
   - Place your Zerodha (or other platform) API key in `api_key.txt`.
   - Session tokens (when generated) can be stored in `access_token.txt`.

4. **Run a script:**
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python mainfile.py
     ```

   - For specific strategy scripts, review the relevant `.py` file and execute as needed.

## Usage Notes

- This repository contains sensitive configuration files. **Do not share keys or tokens.**
- Explore each script for specific usage instructions, input parameters, and output handling.
- Many scripts are named descriptively for their function (e.g., `candle and Pivot scanner.py`, `order placed succesfull.py`).

## Disclaimer

This repository is for research and educational purposes. Use in live trading carries risk—**test thoroughly with paper trading or backtesting before deploying any strategy in a live environment**.
